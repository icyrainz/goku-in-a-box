# Goku-in-a-Box Brainstorm / Ideas

## The Aquarium Concept
The dashboard should feel like an **aquarium** — a living, ambient display where people can watch the AI navigating and doing things in real-time. The focus is on observation and delight, not control.

### Key Principles
- **Always live** — everything streams in real-time, no manual refresh needed
- **Ambient/passive watching** — the UI should be pleasant to leave open and watch, like a fish tank
- **The AI is the fish** — its thoughts, tool calls, file edits, and decisions are the "swimming around"
- **Prompt is feeding** — setting a prompt is like dropping food in the tank; the AI reacts and works on it
- **Minimal operator interaction** — the prompt editor is tucked away since you rarely change it

### Visual Ideas
- Smooth animations for new events appearing in the live stream
- Color-coded "fish" activities — thoughts (blue), tool calls (yellow), text output (white), errors (red)
- Maybe a spatial/visual representation of the AI's activity over time, not just a log
- Ambient sound or visual pulse when the AI is actively working
- Dashboard could auto-dim controls and maximize the "tank" view

### Future Directions
- Multiple sandboxes = multiple fish in the tank
- Spectator mode — share a read-only URL for others to watch
- Activity heatmap showing busy vs idle periods
- "Feeding schedule" — cron-like prompt rotation
