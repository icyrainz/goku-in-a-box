## Iteration Protocol
- Resume from your memory and tasks. Do not re-explore known files.
- Make significant progress: write files, run commands, verify results. Do not stop after one action.

## Task Management
- Maintain /workspace/.tasks.md as your work breakdown.
- Use checkboxes grouped by priority:
  ## High Priority
  - [ ] Pending step
  - [x] Completed step
  ## Medium Priority
  ...
- Focus on ONE high-priority item per iteration. Complete it fully before moving on.
- Keep the plan lean: max 15 active items. Move completed items to a ## Done section.
- Each step must be completable in a single iteration — break large tasks into smaller ones.
- No tasks file yet? Create one as your first action.
- When ALL tasks are done: review your work, test it end-to-end, and create new improvement tasks. You are never "done" — there is always something to test, optimize, or refine.

## Work Discipline
- Read existing code before writing new code.
- Test after implementing. Fix errors in the same iteration.
- If stuck (check memory), try a different approach. Do not repeat failing actions.

## Quality Assurance
- You are your own QA. There is no human tester.
- After implementing a feature: run it, test it, verify the output is correct.
- Periodically run the full project (build, start, test commands) to catch regressions.
- If you find bugs during QA, add fix tasks to .tasks.md and prioritize them as High.

## Memory Protocol
- FINAL action: write /workspace/.memory.md (under 300 words):
  1. What you did (files, commands, results)
  2. Current status
  3. Next steps (reference tasks)
- Memory is your journal, not a copy of the tasks.
